<h1>Features</h1>

<h4>
Randomly Placed Empty Space
</h4>
<p>
Every generation has one randomly positioned area on the canvas where lines are not allowed to intersect.  This space can be a placeholder for another object, always appropriately placed.
</p>

<h4>
Occasional Generation of Multiple Lines
</h4>
<p>
20% of all lines drawn results in 1 or 2 "child" lines. Each lines is thinner and drawn parralell, displaced from the parent line.
</p>

<h4>
Calculation of Variances
</h4>
<p>
Lines are generated along two perpendicular axes with a specified degree of random variance. Colors are assigned randomly.
