<h1>Features</h1>

<h2>
Randomly Placed Empty Space
</h2>
<p>
Every generation has one randomly positioned area on the canvas where lines are not allowed to intersect.  This space can be a placeholder for another object, always appropriately placed.
</p>

<h2>
Occasional Generation of Multiple Lines
</h2>
<p>
20% of lines get 1 or 2 child lines, which preserve the angle, but displace the original position and decrease in stroke weight.
</p>

<h2>
Calculation of Variances
</h2>
<p>
Lines are generated along two perpendicular axes with a specified degree of random variance. Colors are assigned randomly. Show penis.
